                    <p>9. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</p>
                    <br>
                    We encourage parents and guardians to teach their children about privacy and how their information
                    may be used on the Internet. Children should never disclose their name, address or phone number, or
                    any personal information, without their parents’ or guardian's prior permission.
                    <br><br>
                    We consider a user to be a child if they are under the age of 13, unless more stringent regulation
                    applies in their state of residence.
                    <br><br>
                    If we consider that any of our services are directed at users under the minimum legal age required
                    in their country of residence, we can block such users from using the services or from providing
                    information and/or limit the collection of information from such users as described below in more
                    details.
                    <br><br>
                    No personal information should be submitted to HotTunnel VPN by users under the minimum legal age
                    required in their state of residence. We apply the following limitations to personal information
                    collection for a user that does not meet the minimum legal age required in their state of residence.
                    <br><br>
                    Such a user cannot:
                    <br><br>
                    l display their real name or any information in HotTunnel VPN
                    <br>
                    l access the chat, leader board, forums, SNS (Facebook, Game Center, etc.)
                    <br>
                    l subscribe to newsletters
                    <br>
                    l use any other feature where users’ real names might appear
                    <br><br>
                    With respect to such users, we will prevent the collection and use of their precise geolocation data
                    and display to them contextual advertising only (excluding any behavioral advertising).
                    <br><br>

                    <p>10. ORDERS COMPELLING THE DISCLOSURE OF YOUR DATA</p>
                    <br>
                    Our collection of your data is strictly limited. We collect your device identification code, and
                    other data you may volunteer to us when you voluntarily contact us by way of email, phone, or
                    interactions at our website or on HotTunnel VPN’s application page on Google Play or App Store. We
                    do not collect IP addresses, browsing history, traffic data, or DNS queries that could be used to
                    identify you. As such, the extent of any disclosure of your data is limited.
                    <br><br>
                    We are committed to safeguarding your data. Nonetheless, we may be compelled to disclose your data
                    where we are served with a valid court order that is enforceable in Estonia, an order from law
                    enforcement agencies, or where we are legally obligated to disclose your data. We will require the
                    recipient of your data to undertake the protection of your data, to a standard that is at least
                    comparable to the protection required under Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act (“**PDPA**”).
                    <br><br>
                    <p>11. ACCESS</p>
                    <br>
                    When you become a user of HotTunnel VPN, you may request access to your data that is associated only
                    with you by emailing info@whitewidow.digital .
                    <br><br>
                    To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before
                    acceding to your request. Upon our approval of your access request, we will provide you with your
                    data that is in our possession or under our control. Where applicable, we will provide you with
                    information about the ways in which your data has been or may have been used or disclosed by us
                    within a year of your request. We may charge you a fee for fulfilling the access request.
                    <br><br>
                    <p>12. CORRECTION</p>
                    <br>
                    You may make a request to correct an error or omission about your data that is in our possession or
                    control, by emailing info@whitewidow.digital .
                    <br><br>
                    We will consider whether the correction should be made. If such correction is to be made, we shall
                    correct your data as soon as practicable and send the corrected data to every other organization to
                    which your data was disclosed by us within a year before the date the correction request was made,
                    unless that other organization does not need the corrected data for any legal or business
                    purpose.
                    <br><br>
                    To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before
                    correcting your data. Your data may be archived or stored periodically by us according to backup
                    processes conducted in ordinary course of business for disaster recovery purposes.
