                <h2 class="terms__subtitle">
                    These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of and access to our website (“Website”),
                    applications (“Apps”) and other services (collectively, the “Services”).
                    <br><br>
                    The Services are provided by White Widow OU (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “HotTunnel”). Please note that
                    the Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you ("User" or "You") and HotTunnel. By
                    visiting our websites, installing, and/or using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read the
                    Terms, understand them, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms
                    or any provisions hereof, please do not install the Apps and do not use our Services.
                    <br><br>
                    <p>1. General</p>

                    Our Services are virtual private network (“VPN”) services, which enhance internet security and
                    privacy.
                    <br><br>
                    In order to use some of the Services, you will be asked to set up an account. You are solely
                    responsible for all usage or activity on your account including, but not limited to, use of the
                    account by any person who uses your account, with or without authorization, or who has access to any
                    computer on which your account resides or is accessible.
                    <br><br>
                    We do not log or store any records on user’s activity using our Services, but if you choose to
                    create a user account, you must provide some basic information. You must maintain and update this
                    information current, truthful, complete, and accurate. You warrant that you are authorized to
                    provide such information. You authorize us to verify your information at any time. If it is found to
                    be untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we retain the right, in our sole discretion, to
                    suspend or terminate your user account and your access to the Services.
                    <br><br>
                    You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account, username and password and
                    for restricting access to your account. You may not share your password or other account access
                    information with any other party, temporarily or permanently, and you agree to accept responsibility
                    for all activities that occur under your account or password, whether or not authorized by you. You
                    agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account, username or password, as the
                    case may be.
                    <br><br>
                    Your use of the Services is at your own risk. The Services may be modified, updated, interrupted or
                    suspended at any time without notice or liability. We do not bear any liability for any harm or
                    other adverse consequences to you, caused by this. Turbo, its owners, employees, agents and others
                    that are involved with the Services are not in any way or form liable for any harm of any kind
                    executed or intended, resulting from or arising through or from the use of any account registered
                    with Services.
                    <br><br>
                    <p>2. Modification</p>

                    All users of HotTunnel Services are obliged to ensure that they are familiar with the most current
                    wording of the Terms. The change of the Terms may be communicated to you by publishing the updated
                    Terms on HotTunnel website, where the date of the most current wording of the Terms is indicated at
                    the top of the web page. Since you agree to be bound by these Terms each time you use the HotTunnel
                    services, please consider reviewing the terms each time when you use the HotTunnel services. Each
                    update of the terms comes into force as of the moment when it is published on this web page. You
                    understand and agree that any continued use and access to the HotTunnel Services after any updates
                    to these terms are published, means that you voluntarily agree to be bound by the updated Terms.
                    <br><br>
                    <p>3. Privacy Policy</p>

                    We do not log any user activity (sites visited, DNS lookups, emails etc.) We only log access
                    attempts to our servers (for security and troubleshooting). We do not get involved in any form of
                    censorship. We do not give your personal info to any third parties. We do not cooperate with any
                    requests for information unless we are ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction and the vast
                    majority of these requests would not be from a court of competent jurisdiction. We will protect you
                    to the max and our system is setup to automatically do so. There are hundreds of good reasons for being anonymous and we respect them fully.
                    <br><br>
                    For information about how we process information about you and your use of our Services, please see
                    our Privacy Policy.

                    <p>6. Subscriptions</p>

                    By subscribing to the Services, you agree to become a subscriber (“Subscriber”) for the period you
                    have elected. A full list of subscription plans and pricing is available in Apps. We reserves the
                    right to amend subscription fees or institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice
                    posted on the Website or Apps. Any changes to the pricing will not affect the Subscriber’s current
                    subscription period, but may become effective upon subscription renewal, which will be decided
                    solely at the discretion of HotTunnel. Subscription purchases and refunds are handled via multiple
                    third-party payment companies. To find out more about these third party payment companies and how
                    they process your data, please refer to our Privacy Policy.
                    <br><br>
                    Subscriptions will automatically renew unless you turned off the auto-renew at least 24-hours before
                    the end of the current subscription period. The subscription fee will be charged for renewal within
                    24-hours prior to the end of the current subscription period to the payment method you last
                    selected. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to
                    the user's Account Settings after purchase.
                    <br><br>
                    <p>7. Refund Policy</p>

                    (1) If you purchased the HotTunnel VPN product (or Service) from the Apple App Store (iTunes), you do not have access to the 30-day money-back guarantee. Instead, you can
                    request refunds through the App Store, which are issued solely at the discretion of Apple Support.
                    <br>
                    (2) If you purchased the HotTunnel VPN product (or Service) from Google Play Store, you do not have
                    access to the 30-day money-back guarantee. Only if you can demonstrate that the Service was not
                    available or usable during the subscription period and that reasonable attempts were made to contact
                    Turbo to resolve the issue, Turbo may provide you with a pro-rata refund of service fees paid during
                    the period when the Service was not available or usable.
                    <br>
                    Refunds are generally processed within fourteen (14) business days, and are made to the original
                    form of payment used for purchase.
                    <br><br>
                    If you have any additional questions or would like to request a refund, feel free to contact us via
                    the in-app feedback system or email us.
